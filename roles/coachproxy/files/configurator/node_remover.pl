# Get a list of the IDs of each object matching the provided list of names.
# The jq code to accomplish this will look something like this:
#
# .[] | select( (.name != null) and (.name | contains("/heatelec-g8/") or contains("/heatfuel-g8/"))) | .id
#
# ".[]" takes the input array and passes each element to the next code block.
# "select(logic)" only returns objects that match the provided logic.
# ".name != null" is required to prevent errors, since some objects (e.g. dashboard tabs) don't have .name
# ".name |" passes the .name field of an object to the next code block.
# "contains(string)" returns true if string is found inside the input to the code block.
# "| .id" returns the values of the .id parameters in the output of "select()".
# The entire code is wrapped in [] to turn the results into an array.
#
# Two lists are obtained: One for nodes that should be deleted individually (node name does not contain
# the /+pred/ tag), and one for ndoes that should also have all their preceeding nodes removed.
